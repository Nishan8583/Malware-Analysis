# Just some example of malware unpacking code
## 1. Look out for VirtualProtect/VirtuallAlloc during analysis
## 2. Also look for function calls to registers i guess Ex: call rax
## 3. Also look for xor operation, or any type of loop that may decrypt some data, especially if the associated address is called as functon later
